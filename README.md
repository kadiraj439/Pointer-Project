Pointer Project
🎯 Project Overview
In this project, you will build a Task Manager application using three pointer techniques:

Raw pointers to stack-allocated objects
Raw pointers to heap-allocated objects using new and delete
Smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) for automatic memory management
Some guidelines

•    Each part, except Part D, must have its own main.cpp. Do not combine Parts A, B, and C into a single main.cpp.
